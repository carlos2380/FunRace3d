# FunRace3d
Untiy3D


I used I the time for do the exercise. 5h

The difficult part that I feel is get that the player do a nice turn in the curved corners, I would need to check the formulas of angular velocity and then write it in the script for the player does a good turn or find other way that I did.

I would like do all better, for me this is like a prototype with basic mechanics but I could do better effect of the dead of the player with any animation or adding a explosion in the rigidbody, I could and dome animation to the movement of the player, I could add some effect to the finish. Well as I said, there are basic mechanics but it’s all and all is working. I could add a second AI player that this player always runs and add some triggers for said when it has to stop.

As I said for go further on this game, I advancing fixing the turns, and then adding models more animations and effects, doing more “enemies” like the roulette, adding the second player, doing a better UI.

For me it has been a good test but I would have liked to have maybe 2 days for do it and may be get some prefabs, and then do a better version for you. I did a good work in this 5 hours but I know that I can improve the game in general (effects, animations, more enemies, etc).

I don’t know if with step further you mean in if I can improve my code for do the game as Fun Race 3D or if I can imagine other mechanics for Fun Race 3D. But if I had to add some mechanic to the game, I would add a drag in the game and then I add a 2D movement (X-axis and Z-Axis) and I add some other obstacles in the floor to have to avoid.

I hope all is well and any questions do not hesitate to contact me.
